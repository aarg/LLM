a process in machine learning where a pre-trained model is adjusted for a specific task or dataset.

Finetuning is faster and more efficient than training a model from scratch, as the pre-trained model has already learned general features that can be applied to the new task.\n","Finetuning can be applied to various machine learning models, including deep learning models like transformers and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
